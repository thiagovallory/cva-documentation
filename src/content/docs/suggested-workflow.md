1. Create a frame and use your **component name as the layer name**
2. Create the **subcomponents** for what varies and name them "dot property", e.g. `.background`
3. Create a **final** component name `.base`
4. Select **the frame** instead of a component to generate the variants  

ðŸª„ CVA will use the `.base` component to create a new component, with the same name as the layer, and it will use the subcomponents names for the instance variables âœ¨
